 * the daemon broadcasts a lot more than repo state: `settings_changed` carries the owner's tunnel
 * config and MCP rails, `daemon_status` carries the tunnel URL, `repo_added` carries the absolute
 * path of a repo the guest may have no business knowing exists, `scan_*` narrates a sweep of the
 * owner's disks, `approval_pending` narrates their agent traffic. A guest subscribed to the raw
 * bus would receive all of it.
 *
 * So this is an ALLOWLIST, for the same reason policy.ts is: the next event someone adds must be
 * invisible to guests until a human decides otherwise. Unknown event ⇒ dropped.
