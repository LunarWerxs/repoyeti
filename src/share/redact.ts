/**
 * Strip credentials out of a git remote URL.

 * `RepoStatus.remote` is whatever `git remote -v` printed, verbatim (read/status.ts resolveRemote).
 * For an HTTPS remote that embeds a PAT — `https://user:ghp_xxx@github.com/o/r.git`, which is what
 * `git clone` writes when you paste a token, and what several CI setups produce — that string is a
 * live credential. It has always round-tripped to the dashboard, which was fine when the dashboard
 * was only ever the owner's. It is NOT fine for a guest, so it is stripped here.
 *
 * Scheme-aware, because "userinfo" means two different things:
 *   • http/https — the userinfo IS the credential (`user:token@`, or a bare `token@`). Drop all of it.
 *   • anything else (ssh://, git://) — the user is an ACCOUNT NAME, not a secret: `ssh://git@host/o/r`
 *     is the normal form of every SSH remote on GitHub. Dropping it would corrupt the URL shown to
 *     the guest into one that doesn't work. Only a password (`user:pass@`) is removed.
 * The scp-like form (`git@github.com:o/r.git`) has no scheme and no password field, so it's left
 * alone entirely.
 *
 * Regex, not `new URL()`, so it also does the right thing on inputs URL can't parse.

/**
 * A repo as a guest may see it.
 *
 * `absPath` is kept on purpose: the owner's stated case is a second person working the other shift
 * on the same codebase, the UI shows the path, and hiding it would break the product for no real
 * gain (they already know where the code lives). What's dropped is the owner's private bookkeeping:
 * which commit identity and which GitHub account this repo authenticates as (`identityId`,
 * `syncAccountHost`, `syncAccountLogin`) name the owner's credentials, and `autoCommit` is owner
 * automation state that drives controls a guest never gets.
 *
 * `pinned` / `starred` are KEPT, and that is a deliberate reversal. A guest renders the exact same
 * component tree as the owner (AppShell → RepoList), which splits the dashboard into Pinned /
 * Starred / everything-else and hangs the collapse affordance off those section headers. Flattening
 * both flags to false didn't hide a secret — it silently downgraded the guest to a DIFFERENT
 * layout: one unlabelled, uncollapsible list, because RepoList only shows the catch-all heading
 * when a section exists above it. Which repos the owner considers important is emphasis, not a
 * credential, and the emphasis is most of the value of sending someone the link. One dashboard,
 * one layout.
 *
 * `hidden` stays flattened, and is NOT the same call: the share's scope already decides what a
 * guest may see, so the flag has no work left to do here — while passing it through would mean a
 * share naming a repo the owner happens to have hidden renders "No repositories yet" for the guest
 * and looks broken.
