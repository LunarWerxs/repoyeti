/**
 * The stdio MCP server: what `repoyeti mcp` runs, and what an MCP client (Claude Desktop/Code,
 * Cursor) spawns. It speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout and proxies every tool
 * call to the LOCAL daemon over HTTP (httpBackend → cli/client.ts).
 *
 * The protocol dispatch + the stdin→dispatch→stdout loop live in the SHARED engine
 * (./mcp-stdio.mjs, synced from the lunarwerx-ui kit). This file is just the thin RepoYeti binding:
 * it wires the http-backed dispatch context to the engine, and keeps `processLine` exported for the
 * unit tests. STDOUT stays the protocol channel; the engine sends all diagnostics to STDERR.
