/**
 * "Open with…" — launch a repo folder / changed file in an external desktop editor
 * (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, Zed, Sublime, Notepad++, Notepad, …) or the OS
 * file manager, so the owner can jump from the in-app Monaco viewer to their real editor
 * and browse the whole project tree.
 *
 * The editor process is spawned ON THE DAEMON'S MACHINE, so this is only ever useful — and
 * only ever allowed — for a LOCAL (loopback) request: the route gates it on isRemoteRequest.
 * A phone on the tunnel can't (and shouldn't) pop a window on the desktop.
 *
 * Untrusted-path safe: any file path is normalised + confined to the repo (reusing
 * resolveRepoPath) before it reaches a spawn argv, so a crafted `?path=` can never launch an
 * editor on a file outside the repo. The editor id is validated against a fixed catalog. On
 * Windows every editor launch goes through a `cmd /c start ""` hand-off (the shared kit primitive
 * buildDetachedSpawn) so the editor escapes the daemon's process tree and survives a tray Quit; cmd
 * re-parses each arg and would expand `%…%` / strip `^` in the path AFTER confinement, so such a
 * path is refused up front (see cmdReparseHazard) to keep the confinement guarantee intact.
