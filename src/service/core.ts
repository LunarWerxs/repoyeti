/**
 * The GitHub credential a repo's NETWORK op should run under, or null to leave it alone.
 *
 * This used to flip the machine's ACTIVE gh account before the op (and never put it back), which
 * was wrong in three ways worth remembering, because they are why it is done differently now:
 *
 *   - It never restored, so the last repo synced left its account active for every other tool on
 *     the machine — terminals, agents, editors — until something else flipped it.
 *   - It raced. netGate lets several network ops run at once and opqueue only serialises PER repo,
 *     so two repos with different accounts could interleave and op B would authenticate as A.
 *   - It only fired for an EXPLICIT pin, so the common case — a repo whose own git config already
 *     names its account — got nothing, and failed with "could not read Password" while the account
 *     it wanted sat right there in `gh auth status`.
 *
 * Resolving a token and injecting it into the single git child process fixes all three: no global
 * state is touched, concurrent ops can each use a different account, and the answer can come from
 * the repo itself rather than only from an explicit pin (see gh-account.ts).
