/**
 * On-demand "Scan for projects": find repositories on disk, cancellable and progress-reporting
 * over SSE. Two scopes, both driven by the dashboard's Scan modal:
 *   - `rescanMachine()` — sweep the whole machine (home + every drive), the default.
 *   - `rescanFolder(path)` — sweep a single folder the owner chose.
 * Each indexes → watches → status-reads every repo as it's found (mirroring boot discovery in
 * cli/lifecycle.ts) and reports its lifecycle so the modal can show a live "found N" with a Stop.
 *
 * Only ONE scan runs at a time (a second start while one is in flight is a no-op). Repos already
 * known before the scan started are NOT re-announced as "new" — `added` counts only genuinely-new
 * repositories, which drives the "N new projects found" notification.
