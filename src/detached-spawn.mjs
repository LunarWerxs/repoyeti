/**
 * Shared "detached launch" primitive for the LunarWerx daemons — the ONE place that knows how to
 * spawn a child process so it OUTLIVES the daemon (survives a tray Quit or an auto-update relaunch).
 *
 * WHY every kit app needs this: the shared tray host (lunarwerx-ui/src/tray-host/Tray-Host.ps1)
 * Quits by force tree-killing the daemon's whole process tree (`taskkill /PID <daemon> /T /F`), and
 * an auto-update relaunch kills+respawns the daemon the same way. So ANY child the daemon spawns
 * that is meant to keep running past that (a launched app instance, an external editor, a portable
 * chromeless window) must NOT be a descendant of the daemon.
 *
 * The catch (all empirically verified 2026-07-12): on Windows neither `.unref()` nor Node/Bun
 * `detached:true` removes a child from the parent's process tree — a direct spawn is still reaped by
 * `taskkill /T`. So the launch must be handed to a DIFFERENT process creator:
 *   · win32:  WMI `Win32_Process.Create`, driven through a transient `powershell`. The WMI service
 *             creates the process, so it is born outside our tree (detach) AND inherits none of our
 *             handles (see the port-leak note below). `detached` stays false on win32: the detach is
 *             the hand-off, never a spawn flag.
 *   · POSIX:  spawn the command directly with `detached:true` (a genuine setsid session detach).
 *
 * WHY NOT `cmd /c start ""` (what this used to do, 2026-07-12 → 2026-07-15): it detached correctly,
 * but CreateProcess passes bInheritHandles=TRUE, so the launched app inherited every inheritable
 * handle the daemon held — INCLUDING THE DAEMON'S LISTENING SOCKET. The child then pinned the
 * daemon's port for its own lifetime: restart the daemon while a portable window was open and the
 * successor found its port still bound by the dead daemon's ghost socket and hopped to port+1.
 * Verified 2026-07-15 with a real msedge --app window: `cmd /c start` leaked the port, WMI released
 * it while the window stayed open. (A trivial `node -e` child does NOT reproduce it — Chromium's
 * process fleet is what holds the handle. Use a real browser if you ever re-test this.)
 *
 * WMI's own quirks, so nobody re-learns them:
 *   · Win32_Process.Create takes ONE CommandLine string, so argv is quoted back into a command line
 *     with the CommandLineToArgvW rules ({@link quoteWinArg}) rather than passed as an array.
 *   · It launches with a default STARTUPINFO, which means a CONSOLE program gets a VISIBLE console
 *     window. Every caller here launches a GUI app (browser, editor); do NOT route a console program
 *     (bun/node) through this without a Win32_ProcessStartup ShowWindow=0 — and note that setting
 *     ShowWindow=0 can also hide a GUI app's window, which is why it isn't set here.
 *   · If WMI is unavailable/blocked, the fallback below is the old `cmd /c start` hand-off: a leaked
 *     port beats a window that never opens.
 *
 * CALLER RESPONSIBILITIES (this primitive is deliberately dumb about them; each caller keeps its own
 * guard where it matters):
 *   · The `%VAR%`/`^` cmd re-parse hazard is GONE on the WMI path (nothing re-parses through cmd.exe)
 *     but still applies to the fallback, so callers routing untrusted/confined paths keep refusing
 *     `%`/`^` up front. See RepoYeti's cmdReparseHazard.
 *   · Neither path can relaunch a spaced-path `.cmd`/`.bat` shim (WMI CreateProcess won't run a batch
 *     file at all; `start`'s internal `cmd /c "<batch>"` hits cmd's double-quote-strip) — detach a
 *     real `.exe`. A caller holding a `.cmd` shim should launch it on its own plain `cmd /c`
 *     (undetached) rather than route it through here.
 *   · macOS callers that want LaunchServices semantics build an `open`/`open -a` argv themselves and
 *     pass it through — `open` already hands the launch off, so the POSIX `detached:true` is a
 *     harmless belt-and-suspenders.
 *
 * `argv` is the full command line to launch: `[command, ...args]`. Returns the argv to ACTUALLY
 * spawn plus whether to pass `detached:true` to the spawn call — always a fresh array, never the
 * caller's input. Pure + exported so the per-OS detach contract is locked by unit tests
 * (detached-spawn.test.ts). Runtime-agnostic (Bun + Node); the `.d.mts` sibling types the import for
 * the TypeScript apps. Synced from the shared kit — do not edit in an app.
