/**
 * Safe remote git actions — fetch / pull / push — with the non-negotiable guards:
 *  - The daemon NEVER leaves a repo half-merged. Pull is fast-forward-only: it runs even on a
 *    dirty tree (git aborts atomically as WOULD_OVERWRITE if your edits would be overwritten,
 *    otherwise the fast-forward preserves them) and is refused only on a detached HEAD.
 *  - Push is never `--force`. A non-fast-forward push is reported, not forced.
 *  - Every failure maps to a stable, first-class error code the UI can render.
 *
 * Auth + author identity are injected per operation (`-c core.sshCommand` + `-c user.*`)
 * via git.ts — global/repo config is never mutated.
 *
 * This module is split by concern across sibling files (barrel pattern):
 *  - ./sync.ts   — fetch / pull / push / clone + the shared error classifier
 *  - ./commit.ts — whole-tree commit (+ amend), the smart-commit group executor, discard
 *  - ./diff.ts   — bounded diff/status/grep collection for the AI + file-viewer + search
 *  - ./refs.ts   — remotes, tags, branches, stash
 * This file re-exports the complete public surface so existing
 * `from "./git-actions.ts"` / `from "./git-actions/index.ts"` imports keep working.

// back-compat — service.ts and the vcs backends still import them from git-actions.ts.
