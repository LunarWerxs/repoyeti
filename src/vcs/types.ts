/**
 * The VCS-agnostic backend contract — the core of the RepoYeti pivot.
 *
 * Until now every repo operation assumed git. RepoYeti makes the daemon manage *any* VCS
 * (git today, Epic's Lore next) behind ONE interface, so service.ts / the watcher / the
 * routes never branch on "which VCS" — they resolve a backend and call it. Each backend
 * normalises its VCS into the SAME result shapes the dashboard already consumes
 * (RepoStatus, ChangedFile, ActionResult, BranchList, LogResult, StashList), so the UI is
 * unchanged regardless of which VCS owns a repo.
 *
 * The signatures deliberately mirror the existing git functions (absPath + per-op Identity),
 * so the git backend (vcs/git.ts) is a thin pass-through and wiring this into service.ts
 * later stays mechanical rather than a rewrite.
