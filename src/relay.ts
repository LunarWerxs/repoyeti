/**
 * Relay client — publishes "here is my current address" to a RepoYeti relay (see relay/worker.js).
 *
 * WHY: a zero-config quick tunnel re-hosts itself on every start, so any share link already sent
 * stops resolving. The relay gives this daemon one permanent URL that forwards to wherever it
 * currently lives; this module is the half that keeps that mapping honest.
 *
 * IDENTITY: an Ed25519 keypair generated once and kept with the daemon's other secrets. The public
 * half registers on first announce; every later announce is signed, so only this machine can move
 * its own address. That signature is the whole security story — without it, anyone could repoint
 * someone else's link at their own server, turning a convenience into a phishing kit.
 *
 * OFF BY DEFAULT. RepoYeti is self-hosted; it should not phone anywhere unless asked. Enabling it
 * is a deliberate act, and the only thing that ever leaves is (id, origin, timestamp, signature) —
 * never a repo name, never a share token, never a path. The share token rides in the URL FRAGMENT,
 * which browsers do not transmit, so the relay cannot see it even in principle.
