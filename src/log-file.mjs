/**
 * Persistent daemon log — tees console output to <configDir>/logs/daemon.log.
 *
 * SHARED LunarWerx server-lib (source of truth: lunarwerx-ui/src/server-lib/log-file.mjs; synced
 * into each app's server root by sync.mjs, alongside instance-pointer/find-free-port/etc.). The
 * config dir is passed IN by the caller — each app computes its own (REPOYETI_HOME / DEVWEBUI_HOME
 * / REDESIGN_HOME / CCMANAGERUI_HOME, else ~/.<app>) — so this file stays app-agnostic and depends
 * on nothing but node builtins. That matters: it must run as the very FIRST thing at startup,
 * before any config chain that could itself throw.
 *
 * Why this exists: the daemon is normally launched by the tray via `cmd.exe /c bun … ` with
 * CreateNoWindow, so its stdout/stderr go to a hidden console and are LOST. When the process dies
 * (a crash handler calls console.error then exit(1), or the runtime crashes on its own) there was
 * no record of WHY. This captures every console line to a file that survives the process,
 * regardless of how the daemon was launched (tray, terminal, or an auto-update successor).
 *
 * Writes are SYNCHRONOUS (fs.writeSync on an appended fd), deliberately: a buffered stream would
 * lose the final console.error when a crash handler calls process.exit(1) a tick later. The daemon
 * logs little (a boot banner + occasional errors), so sync writes cost nothing here. Everything is
 * best-effort — a logging failure must never take the daemon down (that would be the ironic
 * opposite of the point), so every fs call is guarded and a hard failure just disables file logging
 * and leaves the real console untouched.
