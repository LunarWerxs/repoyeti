/**
 * Daemon-wide caps on concurrent git child processes.
 *
 * Without these, boot hydration (`Promise.all` over every discovered repo) or a burst of
 * SSE clients can spawn hundreds of `git` children at once — exhausting process/disk
 * resources and turning one slow filesystem (a network share, Windows Defender) into
 * whole-machine sluggishness. Two independent pools so a slow network op can never block
 * cheap local reads:
 *   • readGate — local reads: `git status`, changed-files, diff collection.
 *   • netGate  — remote network ops: fetch / pull / push.
 *
 * Gates are taken only around a SINGLE git invocation and released immediately, and a
 * remote op's preflight read finishes (releasing readGate) before it takes netGate — so
 * the two pools are never held nested and can't deadlock regardless of pool size.
