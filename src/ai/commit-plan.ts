// ── commit plan: split a working tree into multiple logical commits ────────────────
//
// "Smart commit": instead of one stage-all commit, the model partitions the changed FILES
// into several scoped commits, each with its own message. File-level only (a file is never
// split across commits) — see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §14 (Smart Commit) for why (the safety invariant). The plan
// is a SUGGESTION: the daemon validates it, the owner edits it, and a separate call commits.

    "file across commits.\n" +
    "2. Group files that implement one logical change together (a source file with its tests, " +
    "types, and docs belong in the same commit). Keep tightly-coupled files together. But PREFER " +
    "several small, focused commits over one broad commit: if two sets of files serve different " +
    "intents (e.g. a feature vs an unrelated fix), separate them even when they sit in the same folder.\n" +
    "3. Isolate purely-cosmetic changes (formatting/whitespace) into their own `style`/`chore` commit.\n" +
    "4. Keep a lockfile (package-lock.json, bun.lock, yarn.lock, Cargo.lock, …) in the SAME commit " +
    "as the manifest change that caused it.\n" +
    "5. Order the commits foundation-first: schema/types → shared utilities → feature logic → " +
    "tests → docs/CI. New files that others depend on come before their dependents.\n" +
    "6. If ONE file genuinely contains two unrelated changes, put it in the commit for its " +
    "dominant change and mention the secondary change in that commit's `body`.\n" +
    "7. Each `subject` is an imperative, ≤72-char summary. Use a conventional `type` " +
