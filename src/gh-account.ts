/**
 * Which GitHub account should a given repo sync as?
 *
 * The owner can pin one explicitly (the repo card's "GitHub account to sync this repo as"), but
 * most repos already answer the question themselves and should not need to be told twice:
 *
 *   1. The explicit pin, when set. Always wins — it is the owner saying so out loud.
 *   2. The repo's OWN git config: `credential.https://<host>.username`. A repo cloned by, or
 *      configured for, a particular account carries this already. It is also precisely the setting
 *      that USED to make a push fail outright: git demands a credential for that login, gh serves
 *      only its active account, and the push dies with "could not read Password" while the account
 *      it wanted sits authenticated two lines up in `gh auth status`. Reading it here turns that
 *      failure into the answer.
 *   3. The remote's owner, when it exactly matches one of the authenticated logins — i.e.
 *      github.com/<login>/<repo>. A personal repo is nearly always pushed as its owner. Org and
 *      fork remotes do not carry a human login in their URL, so when there is no exact match:
 *   4. GitHub's own repository permissions. Probe every signed-in account and use the unique one
 *      with push access. When several can push, prefer the active one; otherwise the choice is
 *      genuinely ambiguous and falls through rather than guessing.
 *
 * Nothing here mutates git config or gh state; every step is a read. When no step answers, the
 * result is null and the operation runs unauthenticated-by-us — i.e. exactly as it did before,
 * under whatever credential helper the machine already has.
