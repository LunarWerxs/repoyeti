// Build a GitHub Release body from CHANGELOG.md.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the Release workflow used `generate_release_notes: true` alone, which
// summarises the COMMITS in the range. This repo ships one squashed commit per release, so that
// produced a body containing nothing but a "Full Changelog" compare link — a release page that
// tells you nothing and makes you go find the changelog yourself. The changelog entry is already
// written for humans; this just puts it on the release page.
//
// Shape: a scannable one-line-per-change list up top (the bolded lead-in of each bullet, which is
// written to stand alone), then the full prose folded away for anyone who wants the detail, then
// where to get the binaries. The workflow still appends its generated "Full Changelog" link.
//
// Usage: node scripts/release-notes.mjs <version> [--repo owner/name] > notes.md

 * One scannable line per change: the bolded lead-in that opens each bullet.

 * Every changelog bullet here is written as "- **Headline sentence.** explanation…", so the bold
 * run IS the summary and needs no rewriting. Bullets that don't follow the pattern fall back to
 * their first sentence rather than being dropped — a silently missing entry would be worse than
 * a slightly long one. Group headings (### Added) are kept so the list stays sorted by kind.
 *
 * A bold run that stops mid-sentence (emphasis covering only the opening clause, "**…off
 * everywhere,** including inside the tree") is carried on to the end of that sentence: cutting at
 * the closing `**` would emit a headline ending in a comma.
