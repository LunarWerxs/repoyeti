# Changelog

All notable changes to RepoYeti are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Select multiple repositories, then act on all of them.** The dashboard's ⋮ menu has a new
  **Select multiple**: every card turns into a checkbox row and a bar rises from the bottom with
  Pin, Star, Hide and Remove across the whole selection. "Select all" honours whatever filter is
  active, so it ticks what you can actually see and never a repo the search bar was hiding. Every
  bulk action offers Undo, and undo restores each repo's *own* previous state rather than blanket
  clearing the flag, so a repo you had already pinned stays pinned. Bulk Remove is still
  index-only and confirm-gated: no folder on disk is ever touched.
- **Per-commit change totals in the history table.** A new **Changes** column shows what each
  commit did (lines added, lines removed, files touched), sourced from `git log --numstat`.
  Big commits abbreviate (`+1.2k`) so the column can't blow out; the exact figures are on hover.
  Merge commits report nothing, because git prints no diff for one.
- **Files *and* lines on the collapsed repo card.** The header used to say only "40 changed". It
  now reads as a pair: how many files, and the line delta beside it. Collapsed you get bare
  numbers; expanding the card fills them into pills that name themselves ("40 files changed",
  "+1,439 −368 lines").

### Changed

- **AI providers are no longer all listed at once.** Settings showed the entire catalogue whether
  or not you used any of it. Now you see only the providers you have connected, plus an **Add
  provider** picker for the rest; pick one and its key form opens right there. The commit-style
  and diff-detail pickers also narrowed, so their labels stop wrapping.
- **The repo card's ⋮ menu moved** from the end of the fetch/pull/push row up to the card's
  identity line, immediately right of Refresh and the remote-presence cloud. Its contents are
  unchanged.
- **The changed-files tree is tighter and no longer crowds its right edge.** Rows lost a couple of
  pixels of height, and the status letter (M / D / A) gained the padding it was missing.
- **Pinned and Starred cards drop their own badge inside their own section.** The section heading
  above the card already says it; the icon only restated it. The badges still appear anywhere else
  the card shows up.
- **Collapse all stays put.** It used to vanish in list view or while searching, which changed the
  toolbar's button count and slid the other controls around under the pointer. It now stays in
  place and greys out when there is nothing to collapse.

### Fixed

- **The history table's column titles now sit over their columns.** The header row and each commit
  row are separate CSS grids, and both used content-sized tracks, so the header sized itself to
  the word "AUTHOR" while every row sized to its own author name and the two drifted apart by up
  to 23px. They now share one fixed template.
- **The Settings tab indicator no longer sits off-centre on its tab.** The sliding highlight was
  anchored with the tab strip's padding *and* translated by an offset that already included that
  padding, so it double-counted and rendered ~4px right of the tab it marks: dead space on the
  right of a wide tab, none on the left. (Fixed in the shared UI kit, so the other LunarWerx apps
  get it too.)
- **The Remove-repo dialog no longer scrolls sideways.** A long repo path forced the whole modal
  wider than the screen. The path now lives in its own scrolling box with a copy button.
- **Smart Commit falls back predictably when the AI planner is unavailable.** You choose what
  happens instead of it silently doing nothing.
- **Windows: the daemon no longer keeps its port pinned after exit.** Child processes are detached
  via WMI, so a restart doesn't hop to the next port.
- **Drag-to-reorder works for mouse users again**, and tall dialogs scroll instead of overflowing
  off-screen.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Shipped the portable-window type declarations that 0.6.0's release build left behind.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-16

### Security

- **A loopback CSRF-to-RCE hole on the local `/api` path is closed.** Any page you visited in a
  browser on the same machine could reach the daemon's local API. It now consumes the shared kit's
  loopback-guard primitive, so the check is one implementation across every LunarWerx app rather
  than a per-app copy.

### Fixed

- **Sign-in was broken for everyone, permanently.** A dead GitMob `client_secret` meant every
  attempt failed; there was no combination of retries that would have worked.
- **Portable-window sizing.** Forwarded launches now honour the `?window-size` hint, and a window
  that has never been opened before starts at a measured 840×760 instead of an arbitrary default.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **Rename and Remove, on every repo card** (overflow menu). Two things the dashboard simply had no
  button for.
  - **Rename** sets a display label. Your folder keeps its own name — nothing on disk is moved or
    renamed — and the label survives a rescan. Clear it to fall back to the folder name.
  - **Remove from RepoYeti** takes a repo out of the list *only*: the folder, the files and the git
    history are never touched. It also stops future scans re-adding it (a removal that a rescan
    silently undid would be no removal at all), and both actions offer Undo. Restore anything you
    removed from Settings.

### Changed

- Commit identities now stay out of the way until you use them. If you commit as one person — which
  is nearly everyone — the identity picker, the identity manager and the Identity Firewall are
  hidden, and the Settings tab reads "Accounts". They come back on their own the moment you save a
  second identity, pin a Firewall rule, or assign one to a repo; "Using more than one git identity?
  → Set up" turns them on by hand. GitHub accounts are unaffected and always shown: an account is
  who you authenticate as, an identity is the name on the commit, and only the second one was
  asking a question most people never need to answer.
- Smart Commit asks the model for each commit's body as a *list* of points rather than as one
  block of prose, and asks for roughly one point per file the commit touches. Prose has no unit to
  be short of, so "- improved db logic" was a complete answer and the model stopped there; a list
  of one point per file is not something a single vague line can satisfy.
- Commit-message style now sizes the AI's token reservation: `concise` reserves far less (it emits
  no body), `detailed` reserves more. Reduces rejections on rate-limited free tiers, where a
  provider gates on the reservation rather than what the reply actually uses.
- The AI's decoding is now set explicitly instead of inheriting each provider's default. Smart
  Commit decodes greedily, because it must return valid JSON and an unparseable reply costs a retry
  and then a worse, non-AI split.
- The message prompt's worked example now rides as a real example exchange (an example diff and its
  finished message, as prior turns) instead of text inside the instructions. Rendered in the
  instructions, its content leaked: one live run attributed the example's null-timestamp fix to a
  function in the actual diff. As a completed exchange it teaches the shape and stays attributed to
  its own change — zero leaks in six runs after the move.
- The message prompt tells the model how many files the change touches and asks for roughly one
  bullet each; a count derived from the tree can't be argued down or padded past.
- Commit bodies wrap at 72 columns in code, with continuation indent under each bullet. The prompt
  used to ask the model to wrap, which is asking it to count characters; no tool that cares does it
  that way.

### Fixed

- A scripted rebuild (`misc\Restart-Daemon.ps1` + `misc\Wait-Daemon.ps1`) can no longer end with
  RepoYeti not running at all. The restart killed only the daemon, so the old tray host survived
  with its auto-restart watchdog armed, and the relaunch raced it with a second tray host — a fight
  that on 2026-07-15 left zero instances within ~90 seconds. The old tray host is now a first-class
  kill target (found by its `RepoYeti-Tray.ps1` command line, killed before the daemon so no
  watchdog interferes), the replacement is launched detached via WMI so closing the terminal that
  ran the rebuild no longer tears the app down with it, and `Wait-Daemon.ps1` only declares victory
  after the new daemon stays up — same process, still answering — through a 30-second stability
  hold instead of one second after boot. Also fixed on the way: under Windows PowerShell 5.1 both
  scripts died at startup ("empty string" from `Split-Path`), because a `[CmdletBinding()]` script
  evaluates parameter defaults before `$PSScriptRoot` exists; the root now resolves in the body.
  (Shared tray-host kit files — the same fix landed in lunarwerx-ui and all four apps.)
- Smart Commit no longer reports a deleted line as a deleted function. It read each change with no
  surrounding lines, so a file whose only edit was dropping an unused local arrived as a lone
  deletion under a header naming the enclosing function — and the message said the function had
  been removed, in 4 of 6 measured runs. It now reads one line of context on each side, which shows
  the function still standing: 0 of 6 in the same test.
- AI commit messages write a real body instead of restating the subject. A body like
  `- generate plane pwa` under the subject `chore: generate plane pwa` had several causes and none
  of them was the model being lazy. The largest: a big file's diff was folded down to a list of
  symbol names with no code under it, so the message was written by something that had never seen
  the change — "Modified `AI_ADAPTERS` record to accommodate changes" was the best answer that
  input allowed. A folded file now carries real diff lines alongside its symbol map, sampled from
  the hunks that changed the most rather than whatever sat at the top of the file, and within the
  same per-file budget as before. The prompt also asked for "WHAT changed and WHY", which is
  satisfied by re-tensing the subject, and the reply's token reservation was sized for one-line
  bodies. Messages now name the function, file or flag that changed and how, grounded strictly in
  the diff, since the model has no repo history and inventing one reads worse than being brief.
- A trivial change still gets a short message: length follows how much the change has to explain,
  not how many lines it touched.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- AI key health check at boot: a revoked or expired key raises a dashboard alert instead of failing silently later.
- Right-click menus on changed files: open, open in editor, reveal, copy path, add to `.gitignore`, discard.
- Dirty-diff gutter in the file viewer (added/changed/removed line markers).
- Reveal now selects the file, not just its folder.
- Optional auto-approve timer for agent (MCP) prompts (off by default).
- Dismiss and restore auto-detected git identities.

### Changed

- AI is now fully bring-your-own-key; the built-in key mechanism is gone. Keys stay in your OS keychain.
- Model lists hide non-chat models; each provider suggests a default on connect.
- AI commit buttons follow an "enabled" toggle, prompting if a key is still needed.
- Settings reorganized: Sync & Hotkeys split into Background Sync (Automation) and Updates & Hotkeys (General); notifications deep-link to the right tab; scan-roots behind a toggle.

### Fixed

- Pull no longer blocks on a dirty tree: it fast-forwards and keeps your edits, stopping only on a real file collision (`WOULD_OVERWRITE`).
- Branch switch no longer blocks on a dirty tree (same guard).
- Background auto-pull now covers dirty repos (still skips mid-merge/rebase).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- **Brand tray/taskbar icon regenerated** from the current yeti-medallion vector (the shipped
  `misc/RepoYeti.ico` had drifted to a generic placeholder). `misc/Make-Icon.ps1` rebuilds it
  from the committed `misc/RepoYeti-icon.png` master (re-rendered from `web/public/icon.svg`).
- **Settings split into tabs.** The settings sidebar now groups its ten sections under four tabs
  (General / Identities / Automation / Access) instead of one long scroll, landing on General so
  the everyday knobs come first and the power-user sections (Identity Firewall, Agent Safety
  Rail, AI providers, tunnel) stay one click away. The old combined identity-and-access section
  was split into `IdentitiesSection` and `AccessSection`.
- **Remote access asks, not redirects.** Flipping the Remote access toggle (Settings → Access,
  or the header Connection dialog) on an unclaimed daemon no longer bounces the page to the
  Connections OAuth login mid-toggle; it discloses an inline "Sign in with Connections" prompt
  instead. The Stable address (tunnel) block, "Sign out everywhere", and the
  editing-over-remote policy toggle are now hidden while remote access is off; they only
  apply when it is on.
- **Quieter search bar.** The repo filter box on the main page sits on a faint fill with no
  border until focused, so it reads as a utility instead of competing with the repo list.

### Fixed

- **Settings sidebar no longer opens with a tooltip already showing.** Opening the panel
  autofocuses its first control, and reka-ui discloses tooltips on focus, so the identities
  info-hint popped instantly. The shared kit's `InfoHint` now ignores non-keyboard focus
  (hover and keyboard Tab still disclose).

### Added

- **Portable window.** A Settings → Appearance toggle ("Portable window") that opens RepoYeti in
  a chromeless Chromium app window (`msedge`/`chrome --app=URL`, its own taskbar entry, no tabs
  or address bar) instead of a normal browser tab. Turning it on persists the setting and opens
  one immediately (`POST /api/portable-window`); the desktop tray launcher follows the same
  preference on every subsequent open, including a cold start before the daemon is up, by
  reading it off `runtime.json`. Off by default (a plain tab). Falls back to a normal tab/browser
  window when no Edge/Chrome install can be found. The window uses a dedicated Chromium profile
  (`~/.repoyeti/portable-profile`, shared by both the server route and the tray launcher) so it
  remembers its own size/position across launches instead of inheriting the main browser profile.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-09

A self-hosted remote git manager: a background daemon plus a mobile dashboard, packaged
as a single `bun --compile` binary. First feature release on top of the v0.1.0 initial tag.

### Release hardening

A pre-tag pass over the whole tree, focused on nothing shipping that shouldn't:

- Removed an internal engineering spec doc from the public tree and fixed every dangling
  reference to it; trimmed `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §16 down to the app-agnostic shared-kit
  story so it no longer names sibling projects.
- Scrubbed leftover codenames for sibling apps out of shared-kit file comments.
- One shared VS Code-style git-status color map now backs every place in the dashboard that
  colors a file by status, replacing four copies that had already drifted out of sync with
  each other.
- One shared identity-firewall glob matcher now backs both the daemon and the dashboard's
  display-only mirror of it, with new tests pinning down edge cases so the two can't
  silently diverge again.
- The self-updater now rolls back cleanly if a build fails partway through an update:
  on a failed install/build after pulling the new version, it restores the previous commit
  and reinstalls/rebuilds it, and reports honestly which step failed instead of leaving the
  install in a half-updated state. Covered by new tests that exercise the rollback against a
  real git repo.
- The optional Connections settings-sync and Lore VCS integrations are now both optional,
  lazy-loaded dependencies — a daemon that doesn't use either feature never pulls their SDKs
  into memory.
- Added last-resort process-level handlers for uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise
  rejections, so an unexpected error is logged instead of crashing the daemon silently.

### Added

- **Auto-commit timer.** An opt-in, daemon-wide scheduler that, for each repo you flag from its
  ⋯ menu, automatically runs the AI **Smart Commit** splitter over its uncommitted changes and —
  configurably — `pull --ff-only`s then pushes. Two schedules: **repeat on a timer** (every
  N minutes/hours, clamped [60s, 24h]) or **once a day** at a set local time. Pull and push are
  each independently toggleable (off = commit locally only). **Safety:** a repo with a merge
  conflict or that is mid-merge/rebase/cherry-pick is always **skipped** (never auto-committed) and
  surfaced via a warning toast; pull-before-push (and skipping the push if the pull fails) mirrors
  "commit & sync" so an unattended run can't publish over a diverged remote. Uses your configured AI
  provider to split the commits, falling back to a deterministic grouping when none is set. New
  daemon module `src/auto-commit.ts` (self-rescheduling timer, mirrors `remote-sync.ts`), a per-repo
  `auto_commit` column, `POST /api/repos/:id/auto-commit`, and the `autoCommit*` owner settings.
- **Tree ⇄ list view for a repo's changes.** A per-repo toggle in the changed-files toolbar (between
  "Search content" and Collapse All) flips the file view between the nested folder **tree** (default)
  and a flat **list** of full paths. Persisted per repo in `localStorage`, like the tree height and
  fold state; reuses the same rows so selection, discard, diff-stats, and keyboard nav are identical.
- **MCP server for AI agents.** A hand-rolled Model Context Protocol server (zero new deps —
  JSON-RPC 2.0 + MCP implemented directly) exposes RepoYeti's git operations to AI agents over
  two transports: **`repoyeti mcp`** (stdio — what an MCP client like Claude Desktop/Code or
  Cursor spawns) and **`POST /api/mcp`** (HTTP, auto-gated by the same `/api/*` auth). One
  transport-agnostic core drives **14 tools** — 8 read-only (`list_repos`, `repo_status`,
  `git_log`, `list_branches`, `git_diff`, `git_search`, `list_stashes`, `drift`) and 6 mutating
  (`git_commit`, `create_branch`, `git_checkout`, `git_push`, `git_pull`, `git_fetch`, each
  tagged `MUTATES`). The stdio server proxies to the local daemon over HTTP; the HTTP endpoint
  uses an in-process adapter. Either way every call runs behind the same op-queue and safety
  guards as the dashboard — the daemon never half-merges, no matter who asks.
- **CLI git verbs.** `repoyeti repos / status <repo> / log / branches / branch / checkout /
  commit / diff / drift / stash / push / pull / fetch` — real shell shortcuts (no `curl`) that
  drive the already-running daemon over its loopback HTTP API and pretty-print the result. They
  locate the live daemon and never start one or touch git in-process (single-instance respected).
  Honour `REPOYETI_BASE_URL` (override the daemon origin) and `REPOYETI_TOKEN` (Bearer auth for a
  remote daemon). Bare `status` stays the daemon-config summary; `status <repo>` is the git verb.
- **Opt-in API token (Bearer) for remote/headless agents.** An owner-minted token
  (`repoyeti token new` → `POST /api/auth/token`, value shown once; revoke/show too) lets a
  remote or headless agent authenticate over the tunnel with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or
  `REPOYETI_TOKEN` for the CLI/MCP) when there's no browser for the OIDC login. **Off by
  default** — when no token is set, auth is byte-for-byte the prior OIDC-only behavior. The token
  is a separate, local credential (constant-time compared, stored in the OS keychain), never
  touches connections.icu, and never weakens the default OIDC posture.
- **Machine-readable API surface.** `GET /api/openapi.json` serves an OpenAPI 3.1 document built
  by introspecting the live router against a curated metadata registry (per-route summary, tags,
  Zod request bodies, query params). It's the one `/api/*` path fetchable without sign-in, so
  agents and tooling can auto-discover the surface; a drift-guard test asserts every `/api` route
  appears in the doc.
- **Merge-commit detection.** The log/commit reads now capture parent hashes, so `LogEntry` and
  `CommitDetail` carry `parents: string[]` + `isMerge`, and `GET /api/repos/:id/log` accepts
  `?merges=only|exclude`. Surfaces in the CLI `log`, the MCP `git_log` tool, and OpenAPI. (Lore
  history is linear, so its backend reports `parents: []` / `isMerge: false`.)

### Changed

- **Maintainability reorg (structure-only, no behavior change).** The three god-files were split
  into layered directories: the read-only inspection layer moved to **`src/read/`**;
  `service.ts` (1075 lines) became **`src/service/`** (core / watch / actions / repo-mgmt / reads
  / files / guards + an `index.ts` barrel); `daemon.ts` (1159 lines) became **`src/http/`** (an
  `app.ts` composition root wiring per-domain `routes/*` behind the single `/api/*` auth
  middleware, plus `respond.ts` / `web.ts` / `openapi.ts`); and the CLI entry moved to
  **`src/cli/`** (a thin `main.ts` dispatcher + `lifecycle.ts`). `check-boundaries.ts` enforces
  the new layering (`read ⊥ service`, `cli ⊥ service/read/git`, MCP core ⊥ service/read/db).

- **Smart Commit (AI multi-commit splitter).** Turn a pile of unrelated working-tree changes into
  an ordered set of small, scoped commits. The daemon proposes a plan (`POST /api/repos/:id/commit-plan`
  → AI, with a deterministic heuristic fallback — nothing is committed), you review and edit it in a
  dedicated editor (rename subjects, move files between commits, reorder/merge), then execute
  (`POST /api/repos/:id/smart-commit`, which re-validates the edited plan against the live tree and
  commits each group in isolation, file-level only). A **YOLO mode** (Settings → AI) skips the review
  and commits the plan in one tap. Never auto-pushes.
- **VCS-agnostic backend.** Repos now carry a `vcs` kind behind a pluggable `VcsBackend` interface
  (`src/vcs/`). **git** is the default; **[Epic's Lore](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/lore)**
  is supported experimentally behind `REPOYETI_LORE=1`.
- **Server registry (API).** Register version-control servers and clone repos from them via
  `GET/POST/DELETE /api/servers` + `POST /api/servers/clone` (→ `cloneLoreRepo`). _Backend + routes
  only for now — the Settings → Servers UI is still pending._
- **Background remote-sync.** An optional periodic check (`src/remote-sync.ts`) keeps each repo's
  "behind" count fresh, with an opt-in **keep-in-sync** mode that auto fast-forwards safe (clean,
  non-diverged) repos. Cadence + toggles live in Settings (`syncCheck` / `syncIntervalSecs` / `keepInSync`).
- **Remote & tags management.** A per-repo "Remote & tags" dialog (repo card ⋮ menu) sets or
  updates the `origin` URL — a local config change, no network — so a repo you created with
  `git init` from the phone can finally be given a remote and pushed. The same dialog lists the
  repo's tags (newest first) and **creates a tag** (annotated when you add a message), optionally
  **pushing it to origin** — "tag a release from your phone." Backed by `POST`/`DELETE
  /api/repos/:id/remote` (URL-scheme validated), `GET /api/repos/:id/tags`, and
  `POST /api/repos/:id/tag` (git-only, ref-name validated).
- **Clone from URL.** The Add-repository dialog has a **Clone** mode: paste a git URL, pick a
  destination folder (must be inside a scan folder) and an optional identity, and RepoYeti clones
  it onto the machine — the new repo appears live. The URL scheme, target name, and destination
  are validated server-side before any git runs, and the chosen identity's SSH key is injected
  per-operation (same seam as fetch/pull/push).
- **Recent commit messages.** The commit box shows your last few commit subjects as one-tap
  chips — handy when typing on a phone.
- **Scan folders from the dashboard.** Add or remove discovery roots in **Settings → Scan
  folders** (no more CLI-only `repoyeti add-root`). Adding one scans it immediately and the repos
  stream in live; removing one drops the auto-discovered repos found under it (repos you added
  explicitly by path are kept). The empty state now offers "Add a scan folder" too.
- **Fetch all.** A header button fetches every repo that has a remote in one tap (bounded by the
  network gate), then reports a one-line summary of what succeeded / failed.
- **Sign out everywhere.** Settings → Access can invalidate the session on every device at once.
  Sessions are stateless signed cookies, so this rotates the daemon's signing key — every existing
  cookie stops verifying instantly.
- **Branches.** Each repo card now lists its local branches (with ahead/behind), lets you
  **switch** to one (refused on a dirty tree — "stash or resolve at your desk"), **create** a
  new branch (＋), and **safe-delete** a merged local branch (`-d` only; the current branch and
  protected `main`/`master`/`develop`/`trunk` are refused, and an unmerged branch surfaces
  `UNMERGED_BRANCH` rather than being force-deleted).
- **Commit history.** A lazy, paginated read-only log per repo (short hash · subject · author ·
  relative time; tap a hash to copy it), backed by `GET /api/repos/:id/log`.
- **Stash.** Stash all changes — including untracked — to escape the "dirty tree blocks pull"
  dead-end, then **pop** or **drop** from the phone. A conflicting pop keeps the stash entry and
  reports `STASH_CONFLICT` ("resolve at your desk") instead of leaving a silent half-merge.
- **Discard a file.** Revert one changed file to its last-committed state directly from the
  changes tree (confirm-gated) — the inverse of the in-app editor. Path-confined and behind the
  per-repo op-queue, like every other mutation.
- **In-app file viewer.** Click any changed file in a repo's tree to open its contents in an
  inline Monaco (VS Code) editor — a right-side push-drawer on desktop (the page slides left
  and stays centred; drag the left edge to resize) or a bottom sheet on mobile. Read-only,
  syntax-highlighted, theme-aware. A **Content / Diff** toggle (defaulting to Diff) switches
  between the whole file and a HEAD ↔ working-tree diff with GitHub-style collapsed unchanged
  regions, plus a **word-level highlight** toggle and a **split / unified** layout toggle (all
  persisted). Backed by read-only, path-confined `GET /api/repos/:id/file` and `/diff`
  endpoints (binary, deleted-file, and oversized cases handled). Monaco is lazy-loaded and
  excluded from the PWA precache so it never bloats the initial app.
- **Internationalisation scaffolding (i18n).** All UI copy runs through `vue-i18n` rather than
  hardcoded strings, so locales can be added later. **Only English (`en.json`) ships today** —
  the earlier machine-translated drafts and the language switcher were removed; `bun run i18n:check`
  keeps the codebase translation-ready (no untranslated literals, no missing keys).
- **`bun run i18n:check`** — a compliance script that fails CI on untranslated UI strings,
  missing translation keys, or locale key-parity drift (templates are parsed with the Vue
  compiler, not regex).
- **VS Code-style file-type icons** in the changed-files tree, using the `vscode-icons`
  set (real per-language glyphs and colours, bundled offline, tree-shaken).
- **Resizable changed-files view** — a per-repo drag grip (with keyboard ↑/↓ and
  double-click-to-reset) plus a global default size (Small / Medium / Tall) in Settings.
- **Bring-your-own-key AI commit messages** — generate a commit message from the repo's
  diff via a configurable provider (Groq / OpenRouter / Gemini / Claude / ChatGPT /
  DeepSeek). Keys live on the daemon only and never leave the machine.
- **Sponsor credit** footer.
- **Launcher guard tests** (`tests/launcher.test.ts`) — fail the build unless the one-click
  launcher is intact: the shortcut machinery (`Create-Shortcut.ps1`, `RepoYeti.vbs`,
  `RepoYeti-Tray.ps1`, `RepoYeti.ico`) exists, is **committed**, and is wired
  shortcut → wscript → vbs → tray → daemon + icon. On Windows it also runs the tray's new
  headless `-SelfTest` (bun on PATH + daemon entry + the icon actually loading into a
  `NotifyIcon`) and regenerates + resolves the root shortcut. Committing `misc/` (which was
  untracked) means a fresh clone always has a working shortcut + tray icon.

### Changed

- **Single instance + the launcher follows the real port.** The daemon already hopped past
  a busy port; now it records the port it ACTUALLY bound in `~/.repoyeti/runtime.json`, so the
  tray opens the right URL (validated with an auth-exempt `/api/health` probe) instead of
  blindly assuming the preferred port. A second launch detects the running daemon and exits
  rather than starting a rival on another port — across the tray, `bun run start`, and
  `bun run dev` (whose `--watch` reloads stay exempt so hot-reload still rebinds). The Vite
  dev proxy follows the same pointer.
- Web UI rebuilt on **reka-ui (shadcn-vue) + Tailwind v4** (replacing the earlier Naive UI
  prototype).
- **Filesystem-watch fallback polling.** A repo whose `.git` watch can't be installed (OS
  watch limits, unsupported filesystem) now falls back to low-frequency jittered polling and
  logs a warning, instead of silently going stale.

### Performance

- **Bounded git subprocess concurrency.** A daemon-wide read pool (status / changed-files)
  and a separate network pool (fetch / pull / push) cap how many `git` children run at once,
  so boot or a multi-client burst can't spawn hundreds and bog down the machine. Tune with
  `REPOYETI_GIT_READ_CONCURRENCY` / `REPOYETI_GIT_NET_CONCURRENCY`.
- **Progressive startup.** The daemon serves the dashboard immediately and hydrates repo
  statuses in the background (streaming each over SSE as it lands), so a slow or hung repo no
  longer delays the daemon from coming up.
- **Coalesced refreshes.** Bursts of watcher/poll events for one repo collapse into at most
  one in-flight read plus one trailing pass, instead of stacking a deep queue of soon-obsolete
  `git status` reads behind a slow operation.
- **Cached remote URLs.** The origin URL is cached per repo until `.git/config` changes,
  skipping a `git remote -v` subprocess on every status read.
- **Capped changed-file responses.** The changed-files API returns at most 2000 entries with a
  `truncated` / `total` marker, so a repo with tens of thousands of dirty files can't produce a
  multi-MB payload or freeze the tree view.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

Initial public tag of the daemon + dashboard, before the release-hardening pass.

## [0.0.1] — Initial

- Daemon core: repo discovery, `.git` watchers, SQLite state, per-repo status engine,
  serialized op-queue, REST + SSE.
- "Sign in with Connections" auth (config-gated OIDC) + redirect shim.
- Git identities (per-operation `core.sshCommand` / `user.*` injection) and guarded
  fetch / pull (fast-forward only) / push (no force) / commit.
- cloudflared tunnel (+ QR) and the Vue 3 PWA dashboard.
