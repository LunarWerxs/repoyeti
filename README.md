# RepoYeti

A self-contained, **system-wide remote git manager**. A background daemon discovers all your
git repos, tracks their state (branch / dirty / ahead / behind) event-driven, manages multiple
git identities, and serves a mobile dashboard over a secure remote URL so you can safely run git
from your phone — fetch / pull / push, branches, stash, commit, tags, AI commit messages, and an
AI multi-commit **Smart Commit** splitter. A pluggable VCS backend also supports
[Epic's Lore](src/vcs/lore.ts) (experimental, behind `REPOYETI_LORE=1`).

> Architecture & build spec: **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — the durable design doc (was the
> v1 "marching orders"). The product has grown beyond v1; see **Dashboard features** below and the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Status

| Phase | What | State |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — daemon core** | discovery · `.git` watchers · SQLite · status engine · op-queue · REST + SSE | ✅ built & verified |
| **2 — auth** | "Sign in with Connections" (public OIDC, config-gated) — daemon's own `/oauth/callback` | ✅ built & verified¹ |
| **3 — identity + safe git ops** | identity CRUD · per-op `-c core.sshCommand`/`user.*` · fetch/pull(FF-only)/push(no-force)/commit guards | ✅ built & verified |
| **4 — tunnel + PWA** | cloudflared (+QR) · Vue 3 dashboard (reka-ui / Tailwind v4 / VueUse / vue-sonner / auto-animate) | ✅ built & verified |
| **5 — hardening + dist** | `bun --compile` single binary · register/create repo · stage-all+commit · port/timeout guards | ✅ built & verified² |
| 6 — Tauri tray | thin sidecar around the unchanged daemon binary | ⏳ deferred (the CLI binary + phone browser is the whole product) |

¹ Auth gating, the login redirect (built from live connections.icu discovery), and the sign-in UI are
verified. Login uses the daemon's **own** `<origin>/oauth/callback` — the old rotating-URL redirect
"shim" Worker is **retired** (`shim/` is now dead reference code). A public PKCE client ships baked in
so login works with zero setup over `app.repoyeti.com`; the only unproven step is a live end-to-end
sign-in with the daemon running. See [docs/REMOTE_ACCESS.md](docs/REMOTE_ACCESS.md).
² PAT/HTTPS-token auth + OS-keychain (keytar) remain intentionally deferred (SSH-key injection covers
the common case); the named-tunnel stable-URL upgrade is documented.

> **Beyond v1.** Those phases were the original build plan. RepoYeti has since grown a large feature
> set on top — branches · commit log · stash · discard · clone-from-URL · tags · remote management ·
> scan-folder management · bulk fetch-all · **Smart Commit** (AI multi-commit splitter) · an in-app
> file viewer/editor · background remote-sync · a pluggable VCS backend (git + Lore) · a server
> registry. See **Dashboard features** below and the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the full surface.

## Stack

**Daemon:** Bun · `bun:sqlite` (WAL) · `simple-git` · Hono · SSE down / REST up.
**Web (PWA):** Vue 3 · Vite · Tailwind v4 · reka-ui (shadcn-vue) · vue-i18n · Pinia.
The daemon is the primary artifact; the CLI is its launcher; a future Tauri tray wraps the same binary.

## Dashboard features

- **Live repo grid** — branch / dirty / ahead / behind per repo, pushed over SSE; drag to reorder, **pin / star / hide**, filter by name / identity / sync state. **Fetch all** with one tap.
- **Safe git actions** — fetch / pull (fast-forward only) / push (no force) / stage-all + commit (with **amend**), each identity-attributed.
- **Branches** — list local branches with ahead/behind, switch (clean-tree guarded), create (＋), and safe-delete (`-d` only; protected branches and the current branch are refused).
- **Commit history** — a lazy, paginated read-only log per repo (hash · subject · author · relative time; tap a hash to copy). The commit box also offers your **last few commit messages as one-tap chips**.
- **Stash** — list, then stash all changes (incl. untracked) to escape the "dirty tree blocks pull" dead-end, and pop / drop from the phone. A conflicting pop keeps the stash and says "resolve at your desk" — never a silent half-merge.
- **Discard a file** — revert one changed file to its last commit, straight from the changes tree (confirm-gated; the inverse of the in-app editor).
- **Remote & tags** — set or update a repo's `origin` URL (so a `git init`-from-the-phone repo becomes pushable), list tags, and **create a tag** (annotated, optional push to origin) — all from a per-repo dialog.
- **AI commit messages (BYOK)** — draft a message from the repo's diff via your own key (Groq · OpenRouter · Gemini · Claude · ChatGPT · DeepSeek). Keys stay on the daemon; nothing leaves the machine without an explicit generate.
- **Smart Commit (AI)** — split a pile of working-tree changes into several clean, scoped commits: the daemon proposes a plan, you review/edit it (move files between commits, rename, reorder), then execute — or flip on **YOLO mode** to commit the plan in one tap.
- **In-app file viewer & editor** — open any changed file in an inline Monaco editor (Content / Diff / word-level / split, all persisted), **search content** across changed files, and **edit + save** a file back to disk (path-confined; gated by a remote-editing toggle).
- **Self-service setup** — add or remove scan folders from Settings (no CLI needed), **clone a repo from a URL** onto the machine, and "sign out everywhere" to invalidate every device's session at once.
- **Background remote-sync** — an optional periodic check keeps "behind" counts fresh, with opt-in **keep-in-sync** auto fast-forward of safe repos.
- **VCS-agnostic + servers** — repos carry a `vcs` kind (git today; **Lore** behind `REPOYETI_LORE=1`) via a pluggable backend, and a **server registry** lets you clone Lore repos from a registered server.
- **VS Code-style changes tree** — real `vscode-icons` file-type glyphs, resizable per repo (drag / ↑↓ / double-click reset) with a Small / Medium / Tall default; optional per-file/per-repo **diff stats**.
- **English UI** — copy runs through `vue-i18n` (the `t()` layer is kept so locales can be re-added), but only English ships today.

## Run

```sh
bun install
bun run src/index.ts add-root /path/to/your/code     # register a directory to scan
bun run src/index.ts start                            # boot the daemon (127.0.0.1:7171)
bun run src/index.ts status                           # print configured roots + indexed repos
```

> The curl examples below are a representative subset — the full API surface (branches, stash,
> tags, remotes, smart-commit, servers, settings, …) lives in [`src/http/routes/`](src/http/routes/)
> and is published machine-readably at `GET /api/openapi.json`.

Then:

```sh

curl -XPOST :7171/api/repos/<id>/pull                                   # pull   (fast-forward only; 409 if dirty/diverged)
curl -XPOST :7171/api/repos/<id>/push                                   # push   (never --force; 409 if non-fast-forward)
curl -XPOST :7171/api/repos/<id>/commit -d '{"message":"wip"}'          # stage-all + commit (identity-attributed)
curl -XPOST :7171/api/repos/<id>/refresh                                # force a fresh status read

# branches / history / stash / discard
curl :7171/api/repos/<id>/branches                                      # list local branches (+ ahead/behind)

curl -XPOST :7171/api/repos/<id>/stash    -d '{"message":"wip"}'        # stash all changes (incl. untracked)
curl -XPOST :7171/api/repos/<id>/stash/pop                              # pop (409 STASH_CONFLICT keeps the stash)
curl :7171/api/repos/<id>/log?limit=50                                  # read-only commit history
curl -XPOST :7171/api/repos/<id>/discard  -d '{"path":"src/a.ts"}'      # revert one file to HEAD
```

## Command line

Beyond the lifecycle commands (`start` / `add-root` / `status`), `repoyeti` ships git verbs that
**drive the already-running daemon** over its loopback HTTP API — real shell shortcuts, no `curl`.
They locate the live daemon and pretty-print; they never start a daemon or touch git in-process
(the single-instance rule is respected). Mirror of `repoyeti --help`:

```sh
repoyeti repos                                            # list repos (branch / dirty / drift / vcs)
repoyeti status <repo>                                    # one repo's status block
repoyeti log <repo> [--limit N] [--merges only|exclude]  # commit history (merge-aware)
repoyeti branches <repo>                                  # branches (ahead/behind/upstream)
repoyeti branch <repo> <name> [--switch]                 # create a branch (optionally switch)
repoyeti checkout <repo> <branch>                         # switch branch
repoyeti commit <repo> -m <msg> [--amend]                # commit staged changes
repoyeti diff <repo> <path>                               # show a file's diff
repoyeti drift                                            # repos ahead/behind their remote
repoyeti stash <repo> [list|pop|drop]                    # stash (no sub = save)
repoyeti push|pull|fetch <repo>                          # sync with the remote
```

> Bare `status` stays the daemon-config summary; `status <repo>` is the per-repo git verb. Point the
> verbs at a non-default daemon with `REPOYETI_BASE_URL`, and at a token-protected one with
> `REPOYETI_TOKEN` (see **AI agent access**).

## AI agent access (MCP)

RepoYeti ships a hand-rolled **MCP server** so an AI agent (Claude Desktop / Code, Cursor, …) can
inspect and drive your repos through the same guarded daemon — it proxies every tool call to the
local daemon over HTTP, so the daemon must already be running.

**stdio (what an MCP client spawns):**

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repoyeti": { "command": "repoyeti", "args": ["mcp"] }
  }
}
```

**HTTP:** `POST /api/mcp` speaks the same JSON-RPC 2.0 / MCP, gated by the same `/api/*` auth.

**14 tools** — 8 read-only and 6 mutating (each mutating tool says `MUTATES` in its description so
the agent, and the human approving its calls, can tell them apart):

| Read-only | Mutating |
|---|---|
| `list_repos` · `repo_status` · `git_log` · `list_branches` · `git_diff` · `git_search` · `list_stashes` · `drift` | `git_commit` · `create_branch` · `git_checkout` · `git_push` · `git_pull` · `git_fetch` |

Mutating tools run behind the same per-repo op-queue and safety guards as the dashboard (FF-only
pull, no-force push, dirty-tree checkout refusal) — the daemon never half-merges, no matter who
asks. The full HTTP surface is also published machine-readably at **`GET /api/openapi.json`**
(OpenAPI 3.1) for OpenAPI-driven tooling; it's the one `/api/*` path fetchable without sign-in.

For a **remote / headless agent** (no browser to complete the OIDC login), the owner can mint an
optional API token and authenticate with a Bearer header:

```sh
repoyeti token new        # mints + prints the token ONCE; revoke with `repoyeti token revoke`
```

Then send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or set `REPOYETI_TOKEN` for the CLI verbs and
`repoyeti mcp`). The token is **off by default** — when none is set, auth is byte-for-byte today's
OIDC-only behavior, and local (loopback) requests stay open in local mode. It's a separate, local
credential and never touches connections.icu.

## Remote access (over the internet)

```sh
repoyeti start --tunnel    # opens a tunnel; an owner must have signed in once (Sign in with Connections)
```

Prints a `*.trycloudflare.com` URL + a QR to scan. The daemon refuses to open a tunnel unless auth is
configured, so the public URL is useless to anyone but the signed-in owner.

### "Sign in with Connections" — baked in (override optional)

RepoYeti ships a **public PKCE client** (a `client_id`, no secret — public by nature) baked into
`src/config.ts`, so login works with **zero setup**: the daemon registers and uses its **own**
`<origin>/oauth/callback` (there is no redirect shim). The hosted instance's IdP allow-lists
`https://app.repoyeti.com/oauth/callback` plus the loopback, so `repoyeti start --tunnel` → scan
the QR → Sign in with Connections → dashboard works out of the box.

If you fork RepoYeti and want your **own** OAuth client instead of the baked-in one:

1. Register a **"Sign in with Connections"** app at `studio.connections.icu` (developer apps) with
   **redirect URI** `<your daemon origin>/oauth/callback` — e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:7171/oauth/callback`
   for loopback, plus your own tunnel hostname — and scopes `openid profile email`. This yields a `client_id`.
2. Override the `oauth` block in `~/.repoyeti/config.json`:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "roots": ["/your/code"],
     "oauth": {
       "issuer": "https://accounts.connections.icu",
       "clientId": "<your client id>",
       "redirectUri": "<your daemon origin>/oauth/callback",
       "ownerSub": "<your Connections sub>"   // or "ownerEmail": "you@example.com"
     }
   }
   ```

> **Deploying behind a proxy (security).** RepoYeti decides "local vs remote" from Cloudflare /
> `x-forwarded-*` headers (see `isRemoteRequest` in `src/auth.ts`). Only expose the daemon through a
> proxy that sets those headers (the named Cloudflare tunnel does). Behind a proxy that strips them, a
> remote request could be treated as local and skip owner auth — bind to loopback instead.

## Testing

```sh
bun test        # 38 test files — git actions/guards · branches/stash/discard · auth · AI · smart-commit · VCS backends · remote-sync · file viewer
bun run typecheck
```

The web dashboard lives in [`web/`](web/) (Vite proxies `/api` + `/oauth` to the daemon on `:7171`):

```sh
cd web
bun install
bun run dev          # dev server on :4319 (proxied to the running daemon)
bun run build        # type-check (vue-tsc) + production build → web/dist (served by the daemon)
bun run i18n:check   # fail on untranslated strings / missing keys / locale key-parity drift
```

Safety guards return first-class error codes: `DIRTY_WORKING_TREE`, `NON_FAST_FORWARD`, `DETACHED_HEAD`,
`SSH_AUTH_FAILED`, `SSH_PASSPHRASE_REQUIRED`, `NO_UPSTREAM`, `NO_REMOTE` — the daemon never leaves a repo
half-merged. Identity is injected **per operation** (`-c core.sshCommand` + `-c user.*`); global/repo git
config is never mutated.

Local state lives under `~/.repoyeti/` (`config.json`, `repoyeti.db`). Nothing is written into your repos.

## Notes for hackers

- Watches only `.git/` + `.git/logs/` per repo (never the working tree) — light on inotify/CPU.
- Read commands run with `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` so status never rewrites `.git/index` (no watch loop).
- Per-repo operation queue serializes all git ops on a repo — the primitive that prevents half-merged state.
- `behind` is from the last fetch only; the daemon never auto-fetches on a watch event.
