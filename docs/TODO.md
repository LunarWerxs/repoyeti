# RepoYeti — Working TODO

> **The single list to work off of — ordered by urgency, not by topic.** It absorbed the two earlier
> planning docs (a release-readiness audit + a 5-lens feature gap analysis); this pass re-cut them by
> priority and removed the overlap, so each item appears exactly once.
>
> **Tiers.** 🔴 **Vital / do now** — blocks a public release, or is a real bug / active breakage (≈P0).
> 🟡 **Big deal** — needed for a polished public reputation (≈P1). 🟢 **Small deal** — polish /
> nice-to-have (≈P2). 🧑 **Needs you** — a decision or secret only the owner can supply (some of these
> also gate the release). 🤖 = an agent can do it. Each item keeps its original code (`A6`, `C1`, `D1`…)
> so older cross-references still resolve. Status verified against the tree on **2026-06-30** (HEAD `fddae3b`).

> **▶ RESUME HERE (next session — use ONE chat).** Tree is **clean, `tsc`-green, web build + tests
> green**. **All agent-doable items are DONE.** Landed: **per-file-staging WEB UI** (`876638a`), **`D1`
> RepoCard split** (`9e36113`), **Lore feature-parity** (already done — re-verified, `535c66b`), **`E6`
> frontend tests** (`f300e7c`). Also this cycle: **`A5` decided** (baked-in OAuth default + documented
> fork-override — ratified as-is) and **`A6` verified to the credential wall** (`/oauth/login` builds the
> correct live-IdP redirect; `handleComplete` unit-tested — only the owner's own password entry remains).
> **What's left is OWNER-ONLY:** the `A6` live login (type your Connections password once), branch-protect
> `main`, confirm MIT, and PAT/HTTPS (needs a real private repo + token). The "niche / someday" features
> (git blame, compare-refs, cross-repo search, web-push, commit signing…) are deferred by choice.
> **Do NOT raise version-cutting / tagging — owner does releases when ready (standing rule).**
>
> ⚠️ **Run ONE agent session at a time** (the owner's standing rule — item **G**): this cycle two
> sessions on one tree collided (a refactor landed mid-edit and broke `tsc`); avoid that by working in
> a single chat. **Constraints:** work **only on `main`** (never branch); **never** suggest
> pushing/tagging/branch-protecting `0.1.0` (owner-only — don't raise it). The gitignored `.env` holds
> `CONNECTIONS_API_KEY` + the Groq key — don't re-ask.
>
> 🗺️ **New backend layout (post-reorg — old `daemon.ts`/`service.ts` paths in this doc are stale):**
> HTTP routes live in `src/http/routes/*` (registered via `register(app, deps)`; composition root
> `src/http/app.ts`); the read layer is `src/read/{status,inspect,diffstat}.ts`; the orchestration
> layer is `src/service/*` (barrel `src/service/index.ts`); CLI in `src/cli/`, MCP in `src/mcp/`. The
> **pattern to copy for a new route:** schema in `src/schemas.ts` → service fn in `src/service/*` →
> route in `src/http/routes/*` → **add it to the OpenAPI map in `src/http/openapi.ts`** (a drift-guard
> test fails otherwise) → a route test. A dev daemon must be **restarted after backend edits** (or run
> under `bun run dev`'s `--watch`); it's single-instance on `:7171`.

> **📌 Checkpoint — 2026-06-30 (this chat archived here).** The agent/CLI-surfaces wave is fully
> landed and committed on `main`, and independently verified at the end of the session: full daemon
> suite green (**315 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail** at the wave; ~318 now incl. the per-file-staging
> backend), `tsc` clean, `check:boundaries` + `check:codes` pass. **Binary runtime-checked:**
> `repoyeti mcp` returns the MCP handshake + all **14 tools** (read + MUTATES-tagged), and the CLI
> verbs hit the daemon over HTTP (friendly "daemon isn't running" path confirmed when none is live).
> The only uncommitted files in the tree are the *other* session's branding WIP (icons / logos /
> `SignIn.vue`) — nothing from this wave is left unstaged. **Resume per the ▶ banner above** (per-file
> staging WEB UI is the next agent-doable item). The lone `mode-events` SSE test is a known
> pre-existing Windows timing flake — not from this work.

## ✅ Landed in the `0.1.0` burndown (2026-06-29 → 06-30, all on `main`)

All verified green at each step (**318 daemon tests** + web build, `tsc`, `check:codes`/`check:boundaries`, lint).

**🔎 Post-stable audit sweep + fixes (2026-06-30) — DONE.** After the backlog was cleared, a multi-agent
audit (bugs / dead-code / mobile UX / test-gaps, each finding adversarially verified) surfaced 22 confirmed
issues; **all 22 fixed** across `115651e`→`9b148d1` (backend correctness incl. a real smart-commit
push-after-failed-pull bug + a log-history-wipe; a phone-first touch-target/hover pass; dedup; ~20 new
tests). Then a lint sweep took **Biome from 57 warnings → 0** (`2431fc9`). Tree is `tsc`/`vue-tsc` clean,
backend **321 pass / 1 skip**, web **41 pass**.

**🔧 Maintainability reorg + agent surfaces (2026-06-30) — DONE.** A run of commits landed on top of the
frontend pass:
- **3-part structural reorg** (`5b77e9b`/`e4eb817`/`00ee787`): read layer → `src/read/`, `service.ts`
  split into `src/service/*`, `daemon.ts` split into `src/http/` (composition root + per-area route
  modules), CLI entry → `src/cli/`. _Most `service.ts`/`daemon.ts` path references lower in this doc are
  now stale — see the new-layout map in the RESUME banner._
- **`feat(openapi)`** (`d240b96`): machine-readable OpenAPI 3.1 at `GET /api/openapi.json`, with a
  drift-guard test asserting every `/api/*` route appears in `src/http/openapi.ts`.
- **`feat(cli)`** (`ba2fa78`): git verbs that drive the running daemon over HTTP.
- **`feat(mcp)`** (`c4483d0`): a hand-rolled MCP server (stdio + `/api/mcp`) exposing the git tools to AI
  agents.
- **`feat(auth)`** (`7a6db83`): an **opt-in** Bearer API token for remote/headless agents (off by default).
- **`feat(log)`** (`e9640a9`): merge-commit detection (`parents` + `isMerge`) + a `?merges` filter.
- **tunnel-URL UI** (`904856e` backend + `9bab202` web): Settings → Access "Stable address" card; redacted
  `tunnel` on `/api/status` + keychain-backed `PUT /api/tunnel`, live tunnel restart when remote is on.
- **per-file staging — BACKEND** (`fddae3b`): `POST /api/repos/:id/commit-selected` + `commitSelectedRepo`
  (reuses the `commitGroups` primitive; stale-selection guard) + 3 route tests + OpenAPI entry. _The
  dashboard UI to drive it is the next item — see 🟡 below._

**🟡 Lore feature-parity port — DONE & verified end-to-end** against a live `loreserver` 0.8.4 (the
`lore` CLI is now installed at `~/bin`). AI commit-diff, smart-commit (plan input + group staging via
`lore stage`+`lore commit`), and content-search (JS scan) all routed through `VcsBackend` and re-enabled
in the Lore UI (`aiHere`). New gated `tests/lore-parity.test.ts`. **`F5` DONE** — `MARCHING_ORDERS.md`
promoted to `ARCHITECTURE.md`, all refs repointed.

**🔴 Vital — ALL DONE:** `C1` (registerRepo → `detectVcs`), `C2` (file diff + discard routed through
`VcsBackend` — `filePatch`/`discardFile` + `fileModels` capability), `E4` (PUT /api/mode toggle +
watcher→SSE delivery tests), `A6` (shim retired — docs corrected, no deploy needed; see finding below).

**🟡/🟢 also done:** `A5` (baked-in OAuth kept as the zero-config default + a documented fork-override —
see 🧑 Needs you), `F2` (CF-header auth comment + README proxy note), `E5` (headless in-memory keychain
stub + legacy-rehome coverage), `C5` (gate-nesting comment),
`D2` (`requireId()` collapses ~20 route guards), `D3` (CommitStyle drift guard), `D4` (centralize
`ok`/`fail`/`PATCH_CAP`), `D5` (drop `workspace_id`), `B4` (CI OS matrix + `bun audit`), `B5` (pre-commit
lint+typecheck), `B7` (pin `@types/bun`, Monaco chunk limit).

**Connections / A6 owner-step finding:** the `cnx_live_…` key is valid with `apps:write`, but the
RepoYeti app (`a790090c…`) is an **AEGIS-direct registration** with no Studio filing-queue row, so the
`studio.connections.icu` API can't see/PATCH it. Per `docs/REMOTE_ACCESS.md` the redirect URIs were
already set in AEGIS via the vault. No write was made; the only unproven step is a **live sign-in**
with the daemon running (owner step). (Key is now stored in gitignored `.env` as `CONNECTIONS_API_KEY`.)

**Frontend pass — in progress** (dev env: daemon `:7171` + Vite + `loreserver`, verified via browser
preview tools). **DONE & browser-verified:** toast-undo (hide/pin/star → Undo restores) · AI-style picker
(Settings → AI; change → daemon persists `style`) · **Lore servers UI** (Settings → "Lore servers" panel
add/remove → daemon persists; Add-repo → "From Lore" tab cloned `clonetest` from a live server end-to-end).
**`F6` a11y DONE** (header role=button + keyboard + chip aria-labels, verified). **commit-detail diff DONE** (tap a History commit → changed files + diff; new readCommit on VcsBackend + route, git verified, Lore degrades gracefully). **tunnel-URL UI DONE** (Settings → Access "Stable address" card: redacted `tunnel` on `/api/status` + a keychain-backed `PUT /api/tunnel`, live tunnel restart when remote is on; 6 route tests; commits `904856e` backend + `9bab202` web). Remaining: **per-file-staging WEB UI** (backend `fddae3b` done — see 🟡), then `D1` RepoCard split (biggest), and `E6` test infra.

**Still open:**
- **`E6`** frontend test infra (Vitest + Playwright) — adds dev-deps to the shared `bun.lock`.
- **PAT/HTTPS:** the network path can't be unit-verified without a real private repo + token (owner).
- **🧑 owner:** branch-protect `main`, confirm MIT, push the `v0.1.0` tag, the live sign-in.

**SDK migration — DONE (owner decided: do it now).** ALL text-scraped Lore reads — status, changed
files, branches, log — now go through `@lore-vcs/sdk` (a koffi native-FFI binding) in `src/vcs/lore-sdk.ts`,
returning structured/typed data (drift-proof; the `lore` CLI has **no** machine-readable output). Lazy-loaded
(a git-only daemon never touches the native lib) with the CLI parsers retained as fallback. Single binary
preserved: `build.ts` keeps the SDK + koffi EXTERNAL to `--compile` and bundles the native libs into
`dist/node_modules` (CLI fallback if absent); compiled `repoyeti.exe` boots clean. koffi in
`trustedDependencies`. Verified end-to-end vs a live `loreserver` 0.8.4 (`lore-parity.test.ts`). _Remaining
SDK-adjacent: the `lore diff`-based reads (file patch / AI diff) still use the CLI — left as-is since `lore
diff` is real unified-diff content, not drift-prone status labels._

---

## 🔴 Vital — do now (blocks a public release / real bugs / active breakage)

**No agent-doable blockers remain in this tier** (`C1`/`C2`/`E4` are done). The sign-in path (`A6`) is
now **verified to the credential wall** (see below); the remaining owner-only steps are branch
protection and confirming MIT (both under **🧑 Needs you**).

- [x] **`A6` — sign-in VERIFIED except the owner's own password entry** *(2026-06-30)*. The shim is
  retired; `src/config.ts` + the IdP use the daemon's own `<origin>/oauth/callback` (loopback +
  `app.repoyeti.com`). **Tested live:** `GET /oauth/login` 302-redirects to the real IdP
  `https://accounts.connections.icu/oauth/authorize` (built from live OIDC discovery) with the correct
  `client_id=a790090c…`, `redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:7171/oauth/callback`, `scope=openid profile
  email`, PKCE `S256`, and a signed `state`; `GET /oauth/callback` (no code) → wired 400. **Completion
  unit-tested & passing:** `tests/auth-oidc-verify.test.ts` drives `handleComplete` with a mock IdP —
  valid id_token → 302 owner-claim success; wrong iss/aud/exp → rejected (46 auth tests green). The one
  step no agent can do is the owner typing their Connections password at `accounts.connections.icu` (that
  first verified login is what claims the daemon). Everything up to and after that credential entry is
  proven working.
- [x] **🤖 `C1` / `C2` / `E4` — ALL DONE** (see the Landed section): `C1` registerRepo→`detectVcs`;
  `C2` `filePatch`/`discardFile` on `VcsBackend`; `E4` `PUT /api/mode` toggle + watcher→SSE delivery test.
  No agent work remains in the 🔴 Vital tier — only the owner-gated `A6` below + the 🧑 release items.

## 🟡 Big deal — before a polished public launch (P1)

- [x] **🤖 `D1` — DONE** (`9e36113`). `RepoCard.vue` 1,535 → 1,184 lines. Extracted the 3 concerns still
  inline — `BranchPanel.vue` (switch/create/delete), `StashPanel.vue` (save/pop/drop), `LogPanel.vue`
  (history + per-commit diff) — plus a shared `@/lib/repo-feedback.ts` composable (`friendly()` +
  `toastResult()`) so panels don't duplicate the error map. The other proposed panels were already done:
  **TagPanel + RemoteManager = `RepoManage.vue`**, **FileViewerDrawer = global `FileViewer` in
  `AppShell.vue`**. All three panels browser-verified end-to-end (history diff, branch create/switch/
  delete-guard, stash save/pop); `vue-tsc` + `i18n-check` green.
- [x] **🤖 `E5` — DONE** (see Landed): headless in-memory keychain stub so the migration path runs in CI +
  legacy `"gitmob"`-service rehome coverage.
- [x] **🤖 `E6` — DONE** (`f300e7c`). Owner approved the dev-deps (2026-06-30). **Vitest +
  @vue/test-utils + happy-dom**: 23 tests / 5 files — `buildChangeTree`, `diffstat`, the
  `changes-selection` store (in a real setup context), a `DiffStat.vue` render, and a Pinia store
  smoke (mocked-fetch `loadChanges`). **Playwright**: one SSE-flow E2E (`test/e2e/sse.spec.ts`) —
  dashboard reaches "Connected — live updates" + renders the repo count; verified locally (1 pass).
  Vitest is wired into the web CI job; the E2E is local-only (needs a live daemon + browser). _(Used
  `DiffStat.vue` for the component render instead of `SmartCommitPlan.vue` — the latter pulls
  drag-and-drop + the full store, too heavy/fragile for a first render smoke.)_
- [x] **🤖 `F2` — DONE** (see Landed): loud `isRemoteRequest()` code comment + a README note on the
  Cloudflare-header (local-vs-remote) auth assumption behind a non-Cloudflare proxy.
- [x] **🤖 `F6` — DONE** (see Landed): card header → `role=button` + keyboard, status chips got
  `aria-label`s, touch-target pass — verified.
- [ ] **🤖 PAT / HTTPS auth.** Unblocks clone/fetch/push/tag-push for **private HTTPS** remotes (SSH-key
  auth doesn't help there). `pat_handle` column reserved; needs keychain + per-op `GIT_ASKPASS`. ⚠️ The
  network path can't be unit-verified without a real private repo + token — needs owner involvement to test.
- [x] **🤖 Per-file (file-level) staging — WEB UI DONE** (`876638a`). Backend was `fddae3b`. Added
  selection checkboxes to `ChangesTree.vue` (a shared provide/inject `changes-selection.ts` store,
  mirroring `useTreeCollapse`, persisted per repo), a "Commit selected (N)" bar in `RepoCard.vue` (with a
  prune watch that drops no-longer-pending paths so a stale path can't hit `PLAN_STALE`), and the
  `api.commitSelected` + store action. Browser-verified end-to-end: selecting 2 of 4 changed files
  committed exactly those 2 and left the rest pending; `vue-tsc` + `i18n-check` green.

### Lore (the pivot — experimental, behind `REPOYETI_LORE=1`)

The core is done + verified (see ✅ Already done). To reach git-parity:

- [x] **🤖 Port the remaining git-only features to Lore — DONE** (was a stale double-listing, like `F5`;
  superseded by the DONE banner in the Landed section). All three are implemented on `loreBackend`
  (`src/vcs/lore.ts`) and wired in: **AI commit-diff** → `loreCollectDiff` (`lore status --scan` +
  `lore diff [paths]`), **smart-commit group staging** → `loreCommitGroups` (`lore stage <paths>` +
  `lore commit` per group), **content-search** → `loreSearchContent` (a JS scan over changed files). The
  frontend `aiHere` gate (`RepoCard.vue:103`) is `store.aiEnabled` with **no VCS check**, so AI/smart-
  commit show for Lore too. **Re-verified at runtime 2026-06-30**: `tests/lore-parity.test.ts` passes
  (1 pass / 21 assertions) against a live `loreserver` 0.8.4.
- [x] **🤖 Lore servers web UI — DONE** (see Landed): Settings → "Lore servers" panel (add/remove →
  daemon persists) + an Add-repo "From Lore" tab; clone-from-server verified end-to-end against a live
  `loreserver`. ⚠️ Reminder for any new server URL: prefer an **IP literal over `localhost`** — a
  `localhost`→IPv6 QUIC handshake stalls ~30 s before IPv4 fallback (ops cap at 120 s via `LORE_TIMEOUT_MS`).

## 🟢 Small deal — polish / nice-to-have (P2)

**Cleanup & dedup + Tooling — ALL DONE** (see the "🟡/🟢 also done" line in Landed):
- [x] `C5` gate-nesting comment · `D2` `requireId()` route-guard collapse · `D3` `CommitStyle` drift
  guard (the `check:codes` test) · `D4` centralized `ok`/`fail`/`PATCH_CAP` · `D5` dropped `workspace_id`.
- [x] `B4` CI OS matrix + `bun audit` · `B5` pre-commit lint+typecheck · `B7` pinned `@types/bun` + Monaco
  `chunkSizeWarningLimit`.
- [ ] *Tiny optional sliver of `D4` not pursued:* a shared `boundedDiffWithFallback()` (the unborn-HEAD
  diff fallback is still copy-pasted across ~3 collectors). Low value; skip unless touching that code.

**Features (occasional / niche)**
- [x] **DONE — commit-detail diff · toast "Undo" (hide/pin/star) · stable named-tunnel URL (the "Stable
  address" Settings card) · AI commit-style picker · Lore SDK read-migration.** All landed (see the Landed
  section + the 2026-06-30 wave); kept here only so old cross-refs resolve.
- [ ] **🤖 Niche, someday:** git blame / per-file history · compare two refs · per-repo AI-provider override
  · cross-repo search · cross-repo activity feed · web-push notifications · commit signing (SSH/GPG).
- *Workspace/grouping UI is intentionally deferred — the `workspaces` table was removed.*

## 🧑 Needs you (decisions & secrets — collect answers, then an agent can act)

- [x] **`A5` — DECIDED: keep the baked-in default + documented fork-override** *(2026-06-30, owner
  delegated the call)*. The public PKCE `client_id` (no secret) + `<origin>/oauth/callback` stay baked in
  so early testers get zero-config "Sign in with Connections" over `app.repoyeti.com`; a forker who wants
  their own client registers one at `studio.connections.icu` and overrides the `oauth` block in
  `~/.repoyeti/config.json`. This is **already implemented + documented** — README §"Sign in with
  Connections — baked in (override optional)" + `src/config.ts` `CONNECTIONS_OAUTH`. Consistent with the
  `A1` "ship the built-in key for the first testers on purpose" stance. No code change needed; ratified as-is.
- [ ] **Branch-protect `main` at launch** *(GitHub settings step once public — owner only)*. Require PRs +
  green CI; no direct pushes.
- [x] **`F5` — DONE** (was double-listed). `MARCHING_ORDERS.md` was promoted to a root `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  and all refs repointed (see the Landed section); the old file is gone. This line was stale.
- [ ] **Confirm the `MIT` license** is the intended one (package.json + `LICENSE` already say MIT).
- [ ] **Adopt "one branch/worktree per agent session"** (G) as the standing process (you run multiple
  agents on one tree; this avoids the cross-session contention seen this cycle).

## 🚫 Rejected by design (do **not** implement — don't re-litigate)

Interactive merge-conflict UI · rebase · `reset --hard` · `push --force`/`--force-with-lease` ·
WebSockets transport · self-hosted relay/tunnel infra · hunk-level partial staging. Each can strand the
repo in an unsafe state on a phone, or contradicts the zero-infra positioning.

## ✅ Already done / decided (so it isn't re-done)

- **`A1` — Groq key: DECIDED, do not rotate.** Owner directive (do not re-raise): the built-in `gsk_…` is a
  free-tier throwaway (6000 TPM, graceful heuristic fallback when exceeded) and **may be shipped publicly
  for the first few testers on purpose** — explicitly **not** a release blocker. Invariant: the real key
  stays in the gitignored `.env` as `GITMOB_BUILTIN_GROQ_KEY`; `src/config.ts` keeps only the placeholder.
- **`F4` — README accuracy pass** *(done 2026-06-29)*: feature list, status note, Smart-Commit/Lore/servers/
  remote-sync, `bun test` line, stale i18n claim, "Run (Phase 1)" heading all fixed. Only the owner-gated
  `A5` infra URLs remain (see 🧑 Needs you).
- **GitMob→RepoYeti rename** (commit `7fd3d39`, 2026-06-29): landed tree-wide and verified (bun test
  258/258, `tsc` clean, `check:codes`/`check:boundaries`, web build all green) — package + `bin` + CLI,
  `GITMOB_*`→`REPOYETI_*` env (incl. `REPOYETI_LORE`), `~/.gitmob`→`~/.repoyeti` & `gitmob.db`→`repoyeti.db`,
  keychain service + health/single-instance identity, the `misc/GitMob.*` files, and the **GitHub repo**
  `LunarWerxs/gitmob`→`LunarWerxs/repoyeti` (remote + package URLs repointed; old URL auto-redirects).
  Back-compat shipped: `config.ts migrateLegacyState()` (one-time dir + db move, default-home only) and
  `secrets.ts getSecret()` legacy-`"gitmob"`-keychain fallback (re-homes on first read). *The only remaining
  rename loose-end is an owner live sign-in to confirm remote auth — tracked as `A6` above (the old Worker
  shim was retired, not redeployed).*
- **Guardrails:** Biome lint + `bun run check` + boundary guard + ApiErrorCode drift guard + 80% coverage
  gate, all in CI · `release.yml` (tag → cross-OS binary + GitHub Release) · pinned Bun + dep cache ·
  auto-enabled git hooks · `.editorconfig`.
- **Architecture:** `ActionResult`/`ActionCode` in `contract.ts`; `cloneLoreRepo` wired to a route;
  `src/paths.ts`/`asResult` dedup; `sessions`/`workspaces` tables removed.
- **Tests:** detached-HEAD (`E1`), push errors (`E2`), SSE/bus (`E3`).
- **Docs/community:** `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue/PR templates,
  `dependabot.yml`; `package.json` metadata (license/repo/author/keywords/engines); the three superseded
  root briefs deleted.
- **Lore (experimental, `REPOYETI_LORE=1`):** web card adapts to `repo.vcs` (a `lore` badge · hides
  fetch/stash/remotes/tags · relabels pull→"Sync"); **file diff + discard ported** (`lore diff` /
  `lore reset --purge`); **servers-registry backend + `cloneLoreRepo`**; **server round-trip
  (commit/push/sync) + clone-from-server verified** against a live local `loreserver`. The Lore CLI command
  surface + the status/branches/log output parsers were verified against **lore 0.8.4** (parsers
  fixture-locked in `tests/lore-parse.test.ts`); the ~30 s `localhost`-QUIC stall is dodged by using an IP
  literal in the server URL.
