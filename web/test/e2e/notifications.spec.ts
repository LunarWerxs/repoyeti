// normal browsing session (one needs a newer build to exist on the update remote, the other
// needs a repo to fall behind between background syncs), so here the daemon's SSE stream is
// stubbed and the real frames it would broadcast are replayed into a real browser. Everything
// downstream of the wire — store handler, bell, prompt, and the buttons — is the real app.
//
// Requires the same running daemon + Vite dev server as sse.spec.ts (see playwright.config.ts);
// every request other than /api/events still goes to the live daemon.
