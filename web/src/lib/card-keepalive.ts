// Bounds RepoCard's keep-the-body-mounted optimization (see RepoCard.vue).
//
// After a card's first expand its CollapsibleContent stays mounted through collapses, so
// toggling is a pure CSS height animation with no rebuild of the (up to 2000-row) changes
// tree. Unbounded, a long session that opens many of the ~50 cards would retain every one
// of those bodies — DOM memory plus a shallow re-render per SSE status tick, forever. This
// registry caps the residency: the MAX_KEPT most recently expanded cards keep their bodies
// while collapsed; older COLLAPSED cards quietly release theirs (they're hidden, so the
// unmount is invisible — the next expand just pays the one-time mount again). A currently
// expanded card is never evicted, even when that means temporarily exceeding the cap.
