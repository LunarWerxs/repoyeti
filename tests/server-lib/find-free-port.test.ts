// Occupy the first free port at or above `base`, stepping past any in use, and return it. Used
// to establish a KNOWN-occupied port for the "steps over" tests. `base` is deliberately low
// (well under Windows' 49152–65535 ephemeral range) so there is ample headroom below 65535 —
// an OS-assigned ephemeral port could sit within `attempts` of the ceiling and make findFreePort
// legitimately run out of ports, which would make these tests flaky rather than meaningful.
//
// `host` MUST match the interface findFreePort will probe: omit it (wildcard) to collide with a
// default findFreePort(port) probe, or pass "127.0.0.1" to collide with findFreePort(port, _,
// "127.0.0.1"). On Windows a wildcard bind and a loopback bind on the same port do NOT conflict,
// so a mismatch would let findFreePort see the port as free and return it unchanged. The listener
// stays up until afterEach closes it.
