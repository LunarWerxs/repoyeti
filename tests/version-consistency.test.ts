// The version is written in three places, and nothing kept them honest. web/package.json drifted

// the root and nobody noticed the other two.
//
// Of the three, src/config.ts is the one that matters: VERSION is what /api/health reports and
// what the updater compares against, so a drift there means the app tells you it is a version it
// isn't. web/package.json is cosmetic (private, unpublished, read by nothing), but "cosmetic" is
// exactly why it rotted — it is the copy with no symptom to notice.
//
// So this is a guard, not a chore: a release that bumps one and forgets the others fails here
// instead of shipping a daemon that misreports itself.
