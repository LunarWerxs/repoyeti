/**
 * The drift guard for the share-link capability policy.
 *
 * This is the most important test in the share feature, and it tests a PROCESS, not a behaviour.
 * The guest gate default-denies, so a route nobody classified is already safe — the danger isn't
 * that an unclassified route leaks, it's that nobody NOTICES it exists. Six months from now
 * someone adds `POST /api/repos/:id/nuke`, never thinks about share links, and the feature quietly
 * grows a hole (or, more likely, quietly fails to work and someone "fixes" it by loosening the
 * gate). So: every route on the live Hono table must appear in exactly one of policy.ts's two
 * lists. Adding a route without deciding is a failing test, with a message that says what to do.
 *
 * It walks `app.routes` — the live truth — and NOT openapi.ts's META, which looks like the registry
 * but isn't: buildOpenApiDoc() emits a fallback entry for anything missing, so META's own drift
 * guard passes while META silently lacks ~11 real routes.
