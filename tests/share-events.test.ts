/**
 * The SSE filter for share-link guests.
 *
 * This covers what was the widest hole in the whole feature. `bus.broadcast()` hands one identical
 * payload to every listener with no idea who's listening, and the daemon puts far more than repo
 * state on that bus: `settings_changed` carries the owner's tunnel + MCP config, `daemon_status`
 * carries the tunnel URL, `scan_*` narrates a sweep of their disks, `approval_pending` narrates
 * their agent traffic, and `repo_added` carries the absolute path of a repo the guest may have no
 * business knowing exists. A guest subscribed to the raw bus would have received all of it, live.
 *
 * These test guestEventData() directly rather than through a live SSE stream: it's the pure
 * function where every filtering decision actually lives, so it can be pinned exhaustively without
 * the flake of racing a stream. The wiring itself (that the /api/events listener calls it at all)
 * is one assertion at the bottom.
